     - Standardization of feature values is conducted using the `StandardScaler` from Scikit-learn to ensure uniformity and enhance model performance.

 3. Data Splitting
   - The dataset is partitioned into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from Scikit-learn. This split is instrumental in assessing the model's generalization performance.

 4. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Model Initialization
     - A Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is employed for predicting Diabetic Kidney Disease.
   - Training
     - The SVC model is trained on the preprocessed training data using the `fit` method.

 5. Prediction and Accuracy Evaluation
   - Prediction
     - The trained SVC model is utilized to predict values on the test set.
   - Accuracy Calculation
     - Model accuracy is assessed using the `accuracy_score` from Scikit-learn.
   - Printed Result
     - The accuracy of the SVC model on the test set is printed for evaluation.

 6. Result Interpretation
   - The accuracy metric provides insight into the model's effectiveness in predicting Diabetic Kidney Disease based on the selected features.

 7. Considerations
   - While the accuracy is a crucial metric, further analysis and interpretation may be necessary to understand the model's sensitivity and specificity, especially in the context of medical predictions.
