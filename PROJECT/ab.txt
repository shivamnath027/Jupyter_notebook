 1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Data Loading:
     - The dataset is loaded from an Excel/csv file ('dataset_file.xlsx/csv') using the Pandas library.
   - Label Encoding:
     - Categorical variables are label-encoded using the `LabelEncoder` from Scikit-learn.
   - Feature Scaling:
     - Standard scaling is applied to normalize the feature values using the `StandardScaler` from Scikit-learn.

 2. Data Splitting:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from Scikit-learn.

 3. Random Forest Classifier:
   - Initialization:
     - A Random Forest classifier is created using the `RandomForestClassifier` from Scikit-learn with 100 estimators and a random state of 42.
   - Training:
     - The Random Forest model is trained on the training data using the `fit` method.

 4. Model Evaluation:
   - Accuracy Calculation:
     - Model accuracy is calculated using the `accuracy_score` from Scikit-learn.
   - AUC-ROC Score:
     - The AUC-ROC score is computed using the `roc_auc_score` from Scikit-learn.
   - Confusion Matrix:
     - The confusion matrix is generated using the `confusion_matrix` from Scikit-learn.
     - Specificity and sensitivity are calculated from the confusion matrix.
 
 5. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve:
   - The ROC curve is plotted using the `roc_curve` and `auc` functions from Scikit-learn.
   - The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is calculated and displayed on the plot.

 6. Results Presentation:
   - Accuracy Report:
     - The overall accuracy of the Random Forest model is printed.

 7. Visualization:
   - ROC Curve Plot:
     - The ROC curve is visualized using Matplotlib.
